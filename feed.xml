    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span/&gt;      An interesting article which shows how Rackspace tries to gain marketshare in the crowded docker tech space.&lt;br/&gt;
    What is currently driving the containerization movement with developers may be, at least in part, the sophisticated and efficient mechanisms for deploying and orchestrating workloads: Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesosphere, Tectonic, Tutum.&lt;br/&gt;
    Rackspace — whose key business has shifted this year from infrastructure to “fanatical” management services — is betting that business executives and decision-makers are actually turned off by the whirlwind nature of containerization. It’s also surmised that these people don’t want their organizations to be tackling the dilemma of co-existence — making their existing, VM-based workloads share infrastructure with what, to them, may as well be invaders from Mars.&lt;br/&gt;
    At the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo last week, attendees received the world’s first peek at Rackspace’s beta of Carina, a container deployment service where the entirety of the orchestration takes place on Rackspace’s end of the bargain.&lt;br/&gt;
